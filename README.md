## Why I Built This App:
As someone whose family are first-generation immigrants, learning languages holds a special place in my heart. It's a way to connect with cultures worldwide and learning my own familyâ€™s language helped me connect with my heritage and background. I genuinely hope this application can be a valuable tool for others who share the same passion for language learning and aid them in mastering the Japanese language.

- Users can save kanji they want to study, and mark them as studied when they have learned the character
- Take a quiz based on all saved kanji or just kanji you haven't learned yet
- Track the progress of kanji learned vs kanji you're still learning
- Saved kanji and progress will persist on page load due to local storage
- Design is responsive across all mobile devices
- 100% Accessible on Lighthouse

## Learning Goals:
At the time of this project, I am a student at Turing School of Software Engineering in the front end development program, in mod 3. This project was created for the final solo project- we have now been learning React and this project was a way to showcase all the knowlege gained from practicing React. 

## Challenges:
The biggest challenge about this project was the "my saved kanji" page. This page allows users to filter through their saved kanji by viewing all saved, kanji yet to be studied, and kanji already learned. Having the components re-render and stay in sync with each other was a challenge as there were serveral different states to keep track of.
